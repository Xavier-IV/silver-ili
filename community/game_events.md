# Read first

Feel free to add a list of events down below. This is to encourage contributing to this open source codebase.

This list of events will be used to affect the gameplay experience, and to share other experiences faced into this game.

Would be great to provide descriptive name, or if necessary with some description as well.

If this is your first time contributing to open source, read the `CONTRIBUTING.md` first. I have no idea yet where to compile all this events, maybe a proper config/json file would make sense. But for now, make do with this first.

## Event suggestions

- Database production went down
- Burnout
- DDoS
- You've been ghosted by recruiter
